2. The site to be laid out in a way that is easy to navigate, so that I can find what I need.

## Design Choices

The Bookshelf has a fun feel to it, with emphasis on displaying books in an easy to read manner. The following design choices were 
made bearing this in mind:

### Fonts
- The primary font 'Roboto' was chosen to be the main text of this site as it is easy to read, looks professional, and goes well 
  with the secondary font. 

- The secondary font 'Rocknroll One' was chosen for the headings as it looks fun, and is easy to read. 

### Icons
- Very few icons were used, as to avoid overcrowding. 
- The following icons were used in [Add book](https://the-bookshelf-milestone.herokuapp.com/add_book) page to emphasize each sections purpose:        
   - The **book** icon was placed next to 'Title'. 
   - The **user** icon was placed next to 'Author'.
   - The **file image** icon was placed next to 'Image URL'. 
   - The **credit card** icon was placed next to 'Amazon store URL'. 
   - The **comment** icon was placed next to 'Synopsis'. 
   - The **pencil** icon was placed next to 'Your review'. 
- The **Facebook logo** icon, **Instagram logo** icon, **Twitter logo** icon, are included in the footer to lead visitors to The 
  Bookshelf's social media accounts.

### Colours
- Yellow: #ffff66
- Orange: #ffcc99
- Light blue: #87cefa
- Light grey: #87cefa

- The bright orange and yellow were chosen for the navbar and footer as they provide a fun, happy feel to the website. No other bright 
  colours were used as the book covers provide an array of different colours. The light gray was chosen for the 'Donate Books' section
  as it goes well with the bright colours, but provides a subtle colour to a page filled with bright colours. The light blue was chosen
  to highlight monthly and user picks in the modals. 

## Wireframes

# Testing 
 
- See seperate [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file. 

# Deployment

## How to run this project locally

To run this project on your own IDE follow the instructions below:

Ensure you have the following tools: 
    - An IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The following **must be installed** on your machine:
    - [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
    - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

### Instructions
1. Save a copy of the github repository located at https://github.com/MAN95-dev/the-bookshelf by clicking the "download zip" button at 
   the top of the page and extracting the zip file to your chosen folder. If you have Git installed on your system, you can clone the 
   repository with the following command.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MAN95-dev/the-bookshelf
    ```

2. Open your preferred IDE, open a terminal session in the unzip folder or cd to the correct location.

3. A virtual environment is recommended for the Python interpreter, I recommend using Pythons built in virtual environment. Enter the command:
    ```
    python -m .venv venv
    ```  
_NOTE: The `python` part of this command and the ones in other steps below assumes you are working with a windows operating system. 
Your Python command may differ, such as `python3` or `py`_

4. Activate the .venv with the command:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate 
    ```
_Again this **command may differ depending on your operating system**, please check the [Python Documentation on virtual environments](
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for further instructions._

5. If needed, Upgrade pip locally with
    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip.
    ```

6. Install all required modules with the command 
    ```
    pip -r requirements.txt.
    ```

7. Set up the following environment variables within your IDE. 

    - If using VSCode, locate the `settings.json` file within the .vscode directory and add your environment variables as below. 
      Do not forget to restart your machine to activate your environment variables or your code will not be able to see them: 

    ```json
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "HOSTNAME": "<enter hostname here>",
        "DEV": "1",
        "IP": "<your IP>",
        "MONGO_DBNAME": "<your database name on MongoDB>",
        "MONGO_URI": "<your URI to your MongoDB database>",
        "PORT": "<your port>",
        "SECRET_KEY": "<your secret key>" 
    }
    ```

    - If using an IDE that includes a `bashrc` file, open this file and enter all the environment variables listed above using the 
      following format: 
    ```
    HOSTNAME="<enter key here>"
    ```
    - `HOSTNAME` should be the local address for the site when running within your own IDE.
    - `DEV` environment variable is set only within the development environment, it does not exist in the deployed version, making it 
      possible to have different settings for the two environments. For example setting DEBUG to True only when working in development 
      and not on the deployed site.

8. If you have restarted your machine to activate your environment variables, do not forget to reactivate your virtual environment with 
   the command used at step 4.

9. You can now run the program locally with the following command: 
    ```
    python3 app.py
    ```

## Heroku Deployment

To deploy The Bookshelf website to heroku, take the following steps:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

2. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.

3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.

4. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. 
   Give it a name and set the region to whichever is applicable for your location.

5. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.

6. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.

7. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".

8. Set the following config vars:

| Key | Value |
--- | ---
IP | `<your IP>`
MONGO_DBNAME | `<your database name on MongoDB>`
MONGO_URI | `<your URI to your MongoDB database>`
PORT | `<your port>`
SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`

9. In your heroku dashboard, click "Deploy". Scroll down to "Manual Deploy", select the master branch then click "Deploy Branch".

10. Once the build is complete, click the "View app" button provided.

12. Your heroku site should run as expected.
